# Convert binary in LL to decimal

---

### Approach 1

using bit shifting
- store bits in all in string
- then do bits shifting and or operation to convert to decimal
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)

### Approach 2

instead of storing bits in string, do inplace conversion
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: o(1)
