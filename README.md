# DSA_leetcode

This repository contains my personal solutions to algorithm and data structure problems from various online judges, primarily LeetCode. I mainly use **C++** and sometimes **C**.

---

## 🧠 Goals

- Enhance problem-solving skills
- Master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
- Prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming
- Track learning progress and document problem-solving approaches

## 🚀 How to Use

Browse through problem folders to find:
- `main.cpp` — Code solution
- `README.md` — Problem statement, approach, and insights
- `testcases.txt` — Sample inputs and expected outputs (optional)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Programming Languages: **C++**, **C**
- Build System: CMake (used for local builds)
- Editors: VS Code, CLion, or others

---

## 🔖 Future Plans

- Solve a wide range of problems across difficulties and topics
- Add categorized tags for problems (e.g., Arrays, Graphs, DP)
- Expand notes section for algorithm concepts
- Possibly include solutions in other languages (e.g., Python)
